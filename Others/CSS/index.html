                    <p>ns-3 has been developed to provide an open, extensible network simulation platform, for networking research and
                        education. In brief, ns-3 provides models of how packet data networks work and perform, and provides a simulation
                        engine for users to conduct simulation experiments.</p>
                    <p>ns-3 is designed as a set of libraries that can be combined together and also with other external software libraries.
                        While some simulation platforms provide users with a single, integrated graphical user interface environment in
                        which all tasks are carried out, ns-3 is more modular in this regard.</p>
                    <p>ns-3 is not an officially supported software product of any company. Support for ns-3 is done on a best-effort
                        basis on the ns-3-users mailing list.</p>
